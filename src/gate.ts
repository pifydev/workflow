/**
 * What a gate actually proved.
 *
 * A gate exists so a step is verified by running something rather than by a
 * model saying it went well. Judging that run by its exit code alone leaves a
 * hole big enough to drive a workflow through: a command that never ran the
 * check still exits 0. A mistyped script name under `sh -c`, a test runner
 * that matched no tests, a `|| true` someone left in — each one reports
 * success while proving nothing.
 *
 * So a gate may state what success looks like. When it does, exiting 0
 * without that evidence is its own outcome (`result_missing`) rather than a
 * pass. The vocabulary is FradSer/pi-monitor's result contract.
 *
 * The same distinction runs one step further. A check that ran and said no is
 * evidence; a check that could not run at all is *not evidence of anything*.
 * A misspelled command, a runner that is not installed, a gate whose own regex
 * does not compile — none of those are the code failing, and reporting them as
 * `failure` sends the reader looking for a bug in the work instead of a typo
 * in the gate. That case is `no_attestation`: still not a pass, but honest
 * about having proved nothing either way.
